## General Template Projects (Front End)

**_Don't Repeat Yourself_**

When I start a new project, working on some new, innovate ideas, always need to start from the scratch. So I decide to create some general template projects. Next time, just copy from an existing project, major, basic works has been done, just focus on the new ideas.

**_Where is the knowledge_**

After a few years work in great company, like IBM, HP etc, I noticed that templates are actually containers of knowledge. Some experienced people created them with their knowledge and experiences, then shared them in templates. With templates, you will easily avoid some basic traps, gain the direction of the tasks.

**_Shortcoming_**

Warning: Knowledge and experiences have expiry date!

And some of them just restrict your choice and directions. When revolutionary technologies appear on this field, abandon template immediately, try new stuff; then create new, better template.
